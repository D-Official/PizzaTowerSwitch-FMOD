# PizzaTowerSwitch-FMOD
This repository contains select code files related to FMOD from the unofficial Pizza Tower Switch port.
With these files, the game's audio code will become 100% GML, allowing it to be ported more easily.

This repository will also serve as an issue tracker: If you find any issue in the port please open an issue here.
***Note that issues should be for the Switch port only, and that any issues opened regarding this port running on Switch emulators will be ignored unless replicated on real hardware.
Same goes for the Android port of the Switch port (Yes, that's a thing)***

This repository is replacing https://github.com/TurtleHouse/PizzaTowerSwitch-FMOD
as the person managing the owner account has lost access to it.

As per the license, and the comment inside fmod.gml: You can do whatever with this code! (and credit would be nice). Go nuts! Port the game to your phone using this! Your smart microwave! 
Anything! It's yours!
